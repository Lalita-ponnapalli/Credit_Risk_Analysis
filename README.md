# Credit_Risk_Analysis
### Overview of the analysis :
#### Purpose of the analysis is to apply machine learning learning to solve a real-world challenge: credit card risk.Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. We Used the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company,we  oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. And used a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. We compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk
#### Being able to predict credit risk with machine learning algorithms can help banks and financial institutions predict anomalies, reduce risk cases, monitor portfolios, and provide recommendations on what to do in cases of fraud.
#### Data used :
#### 2020Q1loans.csv
### Results:
#### Oversampling:
#### Naive Random Oversampling.
##### The accuracy score for the random oversampling is 0.63.The classification report is given as follows. The precision for high_risk is 0.01 and for low risk is 1.00 , very low and high for the low risk, indicating an overfitting for the low_risk. The recall socre for high risk is 0.62  and low risk is 0.65 is not ideal.

### Summary:
#### Without scaling the data, the random forest classifier model is prodcuing the most accurate model at this point, defying my prediction. models have accuracy scores less than 0.7 The precision score for the credit scores are overfit apparently. Balanced Random Forest Classifierhas balanced accuracy score is 0.78.logistic regression model will perform better for this dataset
#### Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier has the highest balance accuracy score. 
#### More detailed model to distinguish the features need to be establlished for a better prediction.
